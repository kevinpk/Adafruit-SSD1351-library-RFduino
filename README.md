###This is a simple port of the Adafruit SSD1351 library to work with an RFduino. test.ino works with the below wiring. You'll notice Serial.begin is commented out. This is to greatly improve the speed of the graphics test (test.ino).

Wire up your OLED as follows:

* GPIO5...MOSI
* GPIO4...SCK
* GPIO2...DC
* RESET...RESET
* GPIO6...OLED/CS
* 3.3V....Vin(+)
* GND.....GND(G)
